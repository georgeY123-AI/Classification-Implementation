 # Classification Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains implementations of various classification algorithms from scratch. Each algorithm is designed to provide a deep understanding of the underlying principles and mechanics of classification techniques. The following algorithms are included:

- **Logistic Regression**: A statistical model used for binary classification tasks.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane for separating different classes.
- **Neural Networks (NN)**: Implements a basic neural network for classification, showcasing the fundamental concepts of deep learning.
- **Decision Tree**: A tree-based model that makes decisions by splitting the data into branches based on feature values.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy.
- **Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT)**: An advanced ensemble technique that builds trees sequentially to correct errors made by previous models.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple, yet effective algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class among their nearest neighbors.
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with an assumption of independence among features.

Each implementation is crafted to demonstrate the core functionality of the algorithm, providing both the theoretical background and practical code examples. This repository aims to serve as a learning resource for those interested in understanding and applying these fundamental classification techniques.

Feel free to explore the code, test the algorithms, and contribute to the repository!
